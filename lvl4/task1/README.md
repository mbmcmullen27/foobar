# Distract the Trainers

This is where I hit a wall. All 3 challenges in level 3 I was able to complete with ample time left over. Each had a 1 week long time limit and I finished each in 2 or 3 days. This one that I'm certain is a variate of the Gale-Shapely Marriage Problem

[Stable Matching with indifference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_marriage_with_indifference)

^^ Something along these lines, indiference because each participant (the trainers) don't care who they match with, they just want to match. More than that, we don't have a male/female pairing of two sets, we have one set that needs to match itself (Stable Roommates variant)

I was fairly certain I found a solution that was technically correct but failing for runtime again. Looking back on what I wrote now, I think the complexity of all my solutions should have been a red flag I was (and still am) missing something obvious. Let me know if you figure out what it is...
