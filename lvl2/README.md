Unfortuantely, didn't have the foresight to save the prompt, but essentially it was something like:
- You need to calibrate the lambchop doomsday device
- at the base of the lazer there are pegs that you can fix gears too
- You have gears of all sizes starting at diameter 1
- Given a list of integers representing the distance between each peg
- fix gears to the pegs so that each gear reachs and turns the peg next to it, and the last gear turns twice as fast as the first gear in the chain
