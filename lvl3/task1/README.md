Again, unfortunately no prompt saved. There was a lot of excitment involved in solving these.
It was along the lines of:
- The lampchop doomsday device requires a precise ammount of fuel pellets to run, but can only handle 1 at a time.
- Minnions will fill the hopper for you but they pay no attention to how many pellets go in
- The hopper can perform 3 opperations, you can add 1 pellet, remove 1 pellet, or split the whole bunch in half
- Given the total number of pellets dumped into the hopper, find the minimum number of operations required to sort down to a single pellet

This one was interesting because it required an optimized version of dijkstras shortest path.
